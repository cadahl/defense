 BUILDING TILED
----------------

NOTE: If you have downloaded the binary archive (bin), then you can skip this
as you will already have the tiled.jar file. Continue to "Running Tiled" below.

Take the following steps to build Tiled from source:

- Install the JDK     (http://java.sun.com/)
- Install apache-ant  (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Run ant in the directory where you placed Tiled

---------------
 RUNNING TILED
---------------

- Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)     (http://java.sun.com/)

- From the command line, you can run the following from the directory where you
  placed Tiled:

  cd dist (if you have compiled Tiled yourself)
  java -jar tiled.jar

- You can also use the Java webstart link on the website, see "Start Now!"

- Windows users that have the JRE installed should be able to double click the
  tiled.jar file to run it.
